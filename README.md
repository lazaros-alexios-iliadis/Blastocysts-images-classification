Code for classification of blastocysts classification based on their ICM score.
First, a noise removal filter is applied to the private data and then the tilt
of the embryos is aligned. A ResNet18 is trained using standard DL methods.

This research was carried out as part of the project "Classification and characterization of fetal images for assisted reproduction using artificial intelligence and computer vision" (Project code: KP6-0079459) under the framework of the Action "Investment Plans of Innovation" of the Operational Program "Central Macedonia 2014 2020", that is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund and Greece.
